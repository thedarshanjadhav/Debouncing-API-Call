# React Debouncing Example

This project demonstrates a simple React application featuring debouncing functionality. Debouncing is a technique used to optimize performance by delaying the execution of a function until the user pauses or stops an action, such as typing.

# Debouncing Explanation

In this project, debouncing is implemented using the useEffect hook along with a timer. When the user types in the input field, the updateName function is called, updating the name state. The useEffect hook with a timer is triggered every time the name state changes.

The timer delays the logging of the name to the console until the user pauses typing for a certain duration (in this case, 1 second). If the user continues typing within that duration, the timer resets, effectively delaying the logging until there's a pause in typing.

This debouncing technique ensures that the logging of the name is triggered only after the user has stopped typing for a certain period, optimizing performance and reducing unnecessary console logs.
